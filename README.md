Abstract:

Understanding how consumer use mobile devices and mobile application to support for food ordering services, such as creating grocery list,gathering meal ideas and ordering food form our home or restaurants, TIFFLUN BOX is designed save time of waiting in the restaurant or home. This is how it works: users can order the food in advance by our app, and it will generate a QR code. When the home/restaurants receive the order, they can start cooking before the busy lunch/dinner time. As long as the meals are ready, they can deliver them to our smart food storage box. Use the QR code associated with the meal to open the smart food storage box. Therefore, food can be placed in the box safely, freshly, and warmly if it needs. After that, user can pick up the food whenever he/she wants with the QR code to open the box.
